## Abstract:
Research on long-tail problems in autonomous driving (AD) perception encounters two fundamental challenges: the inherent infrequency of long-tail data acquisition in real-world deployments coupled with substantial data collection expenses, and the suboptimal exploitation of such rare data by existing algorithms, thereby impeding effective feature learning for edge-cases. To address these issues, this study proposes a difficulty-aware virtual-real interaction solution specially for robust AD in long-tail scenarios, DAVR-LT. Specifically, a unified difficulty metric is first introduced to guide the data generation, enabling more efficient long-tail scenario creation and exploitation. By integrating salient features, including target-centric pixel characteristics and point cloud quality, such a quantifiable difficulty index underpins the development of the Difficulty-Aware Virtual Long-tail Dataset (DAViL), a NuScenes-format compliant virtual dataset engineered to substantially augment data diversity and generalizability. Building upon this, a multimodal scene difficulty assessment framework integrating both dynamic and static risk factors and a difficulty-driven virtual sample fusion strategy are further explored, forming a closed-loop paradigm of ‚Äúevaluation‚Äìmodeling‚Äìverification‚Äù for long-tail data collection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DAVR-LT not only furnishes a novel methodology for long-tail scenario generation but also provides both theoretical underpinnings and experimental validation for enhancing the safety and robustness of multimodal AD perception systems.
